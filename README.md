# AngMongoYoutube

## About

A MEAN stack app using the YouTube Data API. Very early stages, at this point developed for experimental purposes.

## For the Future...

I may create something similar to my [Swiss Army YouTube Searcher](https://github.com/gfed53/youtube-searcher-firebase), upgrading from Angular 1.x to 2+ and using MongoDB with mLab instead of Google Firebase (just to get experience with different technologies). On top of that, an upgraded user experience with more features would definitely be desirable.
